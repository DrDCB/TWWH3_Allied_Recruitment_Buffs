# Allied Recruitment Buffs
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. It seems there are a few mods that tweak this already, but here's another.
* Sets the cap for allied units and Ogre mercenaries to 19 per army
* Boosts Allegiance points gain to +50 per turn (should be capped to 1 per turn for AI)
* Raises the Allegiance point cap to 99999
* Removes the distance-based unit cost penalty
The outpost tier cost scaling remains the same (tier 2/3 halves the cost).

IMMORTAL EMPIRES UPDATE NOTICE:
The tables used in this mod haven't changed with patch 2.0/IE aside from adding in caps for the new daemonic recruitment, which I haven't changed. Since it's possible CA made additional changes elsewhere to how allied recruitment functions, consider this a BETA for the time being until I have had sufficient time to test and investigate. Some users have noted that the AI restrictions don't seem to be applying. Use at your own risk.
